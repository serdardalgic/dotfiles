# Snippets directory

This folder consists of UltiSnips snippets to use in the vim installation.

For more info about how to use UltiSnips, check the documentation. (Also available inside vim: `:help UltiSnips`)

# How to install the snippets:

Create a folder called `mycoolsnippets` under your vim home directory a.k.a. `~/.vim`.
Copy the `UltiSnips` directory (the name must be exactly `Ultisnips` because
that's how UltiSnips discovers the snippets.)

Check the `UltiSnips-how-snippets-are-loaded` part of the UltiSnips docu for more information
