## My toolset:

This page is a first step to automate the tools I'm using. Based on MacOS, I may
update it when I have a pretty new Linux Box as a development computer
:sunglasses:

Those apps are expected to be installed on OS:

* brew:
        https://brew.sh/        
```sh
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

* git, vim, tmux, ack, curl, htop
```sh
brew install git vim tmux ack curl htop
```

* Docker, docker-compose https://www.docker.com/docker-mac

* minikube, kubectl
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/
```sh
brew install kubectl
```

* python

* go

* git-extras: 
        https://github.com/tj/git-extras/blob/master/Installation.md
```sh
brew install git-extras
```

* zsh-syntax-highlighting:
```sh
cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/;
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git
```
